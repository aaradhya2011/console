    Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. To log a message, you 
    insert an expression like console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript. When the browser executes your JavaScript and sees an
     expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to the Console.

<script>
    console.log("Hi I am console screen");

    var first_name="Aaradhya";
    console.log(first_name);

    var last_name="Gupta";
    console.log(last_name);

    var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
    console.log(full_name);

    var length_full_name=full_name.length;
    console.log(length_full_name);

    var capital=first_name.toUpperCase();
    console.log(capital);

    var lowercase=first_name.toLowerCase();
    console.log(lowercase);

    var a=10;
    var b=5;
    var add=a+b
    console.log(add);
    
    var sub=a-b;
    console.log(sub);

    var mul=a*b;
    console.log(mul);

    var div=a/b;
    console.log(div)
